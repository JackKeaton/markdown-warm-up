# Worst website in the World

### Analysis

### What website did we find?
We found this website for a... [Spa and healthcare center](http://www.serene-naturist.com/Naturist.html). **Not only** is it terrible, we're still not sure what it does.

### How did we find it?
Looking for blogs that mock bad website design, we found one that looked rather terrible itself. *This* website however was far worse! One of us is still bleaching his eyes every hour.

### Does it have regular updates?
Define regular? In short, no. It looks like it was made in MS Paint, with just a dash of epileptic seizures mixed in. There are no social media links. 


### What would we change about it?

1. Make a more soothing contrast
2. Scrolling navigation bar
3. Remove Flash elements
4. Exchange stock photo's of actual informative photo's.

### What did this website teach us?

- [ ] Where to go for a good massage
- [x] How bad a migraine can get
